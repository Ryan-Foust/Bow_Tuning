Combining Cartesian coordinates (x,y) or using polar coordinates (radius, theta), calculus,
some basic statistics stuff that I remember, and a bit of just-crazy-enough-to-work attitude

(1) objectively measure how good a group is,
based on either distance to each other or distance to the center of them.
Probably use Cartesian coordinates w/ origin @ top left or bottom left
bc minimize distance between each other or a found center

(2) if a good enough group, give how to correct for general arrow placement to hit closer to center.
Probably use Polar coordinates bc minimize r
